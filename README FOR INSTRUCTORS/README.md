# README Generator Homework
I found this homework to be pretty simple because our group that did the student activity 40 mini project laid a really strong foundation for this assignment. 
I started by inserting the 2 required node modules for the application, fs and inquirer. Then I used the skeleton of the array from the student activity to create the array of questions here. After I had the question array, I used inquirer to prompt the user in command line with questions about information for their README.md file. This function uses writeFileSync and appendFileSync to take the users answers and put them in a README.md and format them with markdown. Adding the badge to the README was probably the most difficult step. I included a screenshot of the application successfully working inside this folder.
