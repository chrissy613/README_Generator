## Installation 
 
 To install this application, you must download the GitHub repository and run three seperate commands in your command line within the same folder as the index.js. Run "npm init" , "npm install inquirer" and "npm install fs" to make sure this app works after grabbing it off GitHub. 
 
 
## Usage 
 
 To use this application, you must get to the folder that index.js is in and run "node index.js" in your command line. You will then fill in the question prompts with relevant information. After the prompts are complete a README.md file is created within the same folder.
